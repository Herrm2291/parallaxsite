    <h2>IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT</h2>
    <p>
      Email me at
			<a href="mailto:jeffwmorris89@yahoo.com">jeffwmorris89@yahoo.com</a> and in the subject <b>PLEASE</b> put your name.<br>
			I ask that everyone please propose their idea as clearly and specific as can be. I need approximate size, location you want it on your body, and if you’d like it in color or not.<br><br>

			Include reference photos. Just a few please, or whatever is needed to get your idea across, as best as possible.<br><br>

			Don’t go into great detail about what the piece is for, or give me a long story to read, please.<br>

			Let’s share that sort of thing in person if you’d like! I would love to hear why you’re getting the tattoo, but won’t have time to read about it!<br><br>

			If you ask me to tattoo someone else’s tattoo on you exactly I will not accept your proposal. If you want something done by someone else go to that person!<br><br>

			Once I review the email proposal I will let you know if I’d be comfortable and confident in doing your tattoo. If I am not, I will still go over the proposal and explain why not, and give other options.<br><br>

			Once we have discussed the tattoo by email, I will then require a $60 cash or $100 credit card down payment to be made at the shop to book! This will ensure your time is not taken by someone else. The appointment will be booked in person. We will not discuss days and times until meeting in person.<br><br>

			The shop has hired help everyday to facilitate appointment bookings and receiving of down payments. We accept credit or cash. Your dowmpayment will come off the first appointment price.<br><br>

			I will do my best to read and reply to emails as quickly as possible!<br><br>

			Thank you for checking out my site and considering me as your artist!
